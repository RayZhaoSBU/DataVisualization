For this assginment, I screenshot the dashboard and add it to PDF for the first two questions.

I did not write a main function for this assignment, so all you need to do is open app.py with Python 3.8 IDLE(64-bit) and click F5.

There are some notes in the program that can help you to understand each step.

For the data, I also provided the original data, which is containing almost 13 thousand rows. I tried it and it works, but it takes time especially for PCA and MDS.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL PACKAGES!!!(of course you installed plotly but in case I list them all)

import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.manifold import MDS
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import plotly.express as px
